# AI Sports Scout & Engagement Engine

> **Status** In Development (Architecture and Backend Phase)

## Overview
This platform will bridge the gap between passive sports viewship and active engagement by gamifying the process. By analyzing real-time statistics from basketball and footboll, the engine generates narrative-driven scouting reports and "2K-style" player archetypes using Generative AI

## The Teck Stack
* **Language** Ruby
* **AI Intellegene:** Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Google AI Studio)
* **Dependency Management:** Bundler
* **Environment Security** Dotenv

## Key Features (In development)
* **Archetype Mapping:** Using prompt engineering to categorize athletes into digital profiles (e.g., "Three-Level Threat").
* **Narrative Generation:** Transforming raw box scores into human-readable fantasy scouting reports
* **Gamified XP Logic:** A backend progression system to track user engangement and decision-making accuracy.

## Engineering Best Practices
To ensure a clean and scalable codebase, this projects utilizes
* Secure API key handling via `.env` files
* Automated dependency tracking with a `Gemfile`.
* Professional Git workflow for version control.
